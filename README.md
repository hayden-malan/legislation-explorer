# OpenFisca Legislation explorer

A web user interface to explore an [OpenFisca](http://openfisca.org/) tax and benefit system model.

This application consumes a legislation description made available by the OpenFisca web API and makes its parameters and formulas searchable and interlinked. [Example](https://fr.openfisca.org/legislation).

## Development stack

This application is based on [Node](https://nodejs.org) on the backend and [React](https://reactjs.org) on the frontend.

In order to run the server or to improve the app, first install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com). Then, run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openfisca/legislation-explorer.git
cd legislation-explorer
npm install --production
```


## Configure the deployment

You will need to tell the Legislation Explorer server where your OpenFisca API instance can be reached, as well as where your repository resides for contributors to be directed to. This is done with a configuration file.

This config file needs to expose a JavaScript object with the following properties:

- `apiBaseUrl`: The URL at which your OpenFisca API resides. For example: `https://openfisca-aotearoa.herokuapp.com`.
- `gitHubProject`: The GitHub fully qualified name of the source repository for this OpenFisca instance. For example: `ServiceInnovationLab/openfisca-aotearoa`.
- `gitWebpageUrl`: The URL at which the source repository for this OpenFisca instance can be found. For example: `https://github.com/ServiceInnovationLab/openfisca-aotearoa`.
- `websiteUrl`: The URL at which more information can be obtained on OpenFisca. For example: `https://openfisca.org`.

### Localisation (l12n / i18n)

The user interface of the legislation explorer has full support for internationalisation. Supported languages can be found in the `src/assets/lang` directory, and can be added by simply creating a new file with the two-letter language code to add support for.

For localisation, you can override any of the strings defined in these files through the `ui` property of your configuration file.

If you export `ui` as an object whose keys are ISO two-letters language codes and values are strings, these values will take precedence over any strings defined in the `lang` folder.

The following strings are strongly recommended to be overridden:

- `countryName`: The name of the tax and benefit system you are modelling here.
    - `forCountry`: In case the default interpolation for your `countryName` does not give good results, you can also edit the prefix added before the `countryName` value.
- `search_placeholder`: One or two suggested searches, preferably comma-separated, for your users to make sense of the search field. Best results will be obtained by using the most well-known parameters for your tax and benefit system.

### Optional configuration

You can also add the following properties:

- `piwikConfig`: An object describing how to contact a [Piwik analytics](https://piwik.org) instance to which usage stats will be sent. Contains the following subproperties:
    - `url`: The base URL at which the Piwik instance can be contacted. For example: `https://stats.data.gouv.fr`.
    - `siteId`: The ID of the site to track in this Piwik instance.
    - `trackErrors`: _A Boolean value._
- `useCommitReferenceFromApi`: _A Boolean value._
- `winstonConfig`: A configuration object to pass to the [`winston` logger](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/tree/2.x#instantiating-your-own-logger) (i.e. what is passed to a `new winston.Logger`).

Some other elements can be configured through environment variables passed to both `npm build` and `npm start`:

- `API_URL`: overrides the `apiBaseUrl` config property.
- `BASENAME` defines the path at which the Legislation Explorer is served. Defaults to `/`. For example: `BASENAME=/legislation` to serve on `https://fr.openfisca.org/legislation`.
- `COUNTRY_PRODUCTION_CONFIG`: defines the name of the configuration file to use in the build stage. This file has to be in the `config` folder and be named `production.$COUNTRY_PRODUCTION_CONFIG.js`. For example: `COUNTRY_PRODUCTION_CONFIG=tunisia npm run build`
- `NODE_ENV` defines if assets should be served minified or with hot module remplacement. Can be either `development` or `production`. Example: `NODE_ENV=production PORT=2030 node index.js`. Prefer using `npm start`.
- `HOST`: defines the host on which the app is served. Example: `HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=2030 node index.js`. Prefer using `npm start`.
- `PORT` defines the port on which the app is served. Example: `NODE_ENV=production PORT=2030 node index.js`. Prefer using `npm start`.


## Run the server

`cd` to the cloned `legislation-explorer` directory, and run the following commands:

```sh
npm run build  # compile the frontend code
npm start  # start the server
```


## Improve the app

You can edit all files in the source folder you cloned. In order to ease development, a different set of commands will allow you to run the app with hot module replacement, which will reflect your changes almost instantly rather than rebuilding the whole package.

`cd` to the cloned `legislation-explorer` directory, and run the following commands:

```sh
npm install  # install development dependencies
npm run dev # To use http://localhost:5000/ for the Web API
npm run dev:prod-api # To use https://api.openfisca.fr/ for the Web API
```

> Some additional commands can be useful for development. You can discover all of them by running `npm run`.


### Tests

This app has both unit and integration tests. Its integration tests are implemented with [Watai](https://github.com/MattiSG/Watai). You will first need to [install its Selenium WebDriver dependencies](https://github.com/MattiSG/Watai/wiki/Installing) to run these tests.

Then, build the app, [run the server](#run-the-server), [run a Selenium instance](https://github.com/MattiSG/Watai/wiki/Installing#selenium-server) and, in another Terminal, run:

```sh
npm run test
```
